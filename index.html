<h2>The Haber-Bosch Process</h2>

<p>Equilibrium plays a vital role in sustaining life as we know it. What is equilibrium? When a chemical reaction is at equilibrium, there is no difference in the reaction rates for both the products and reactants. Thus, the net quantities of the two also remain equal and unchanged. One may deem a reaction at equilibrium complete because it has acquired maximal conversion of reactants to products. Reactions at equilibrium are also "reversible," meaning at the point where the products materialize, they react once more, forming the previous reactants (Britannica). Many meaningful chemical reactions would be futile if not for the concept of equilibrium. One of which is the Haber-Bosch process. This recent development in the chemical world uniquely utilizes the idea of equilibrium to affect man tremendously.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>The Haber-Bosch process dates back a mere century. Industrialization during the late 19th and early 20th centuries had an immense impact on humankind. The period saw a drastic increase in world population, which required a simultaneous accrual of grain. Consequently, farmers began cultivating in regions largely unexplored agriculturally (e.g., Russia, Australia, et cetera). The farmers, who wished to reap quality crops in such places, aspired to introduce nitrogen to the soil, thus beginning the adoption of fossil nitrate and guano to enhance yield (Briney). With this impactful turning point in the worker's life came the increased need for improved developments, many of which were chemical. A synthetic attachment of nitrogen to the soil was at the forefront of many chemists' minds, with one chemist conquering the challenge on July 2, 1909, German scientist Fritz Haber. Haber uniquely synthesized ammonia by feeding gaseous nitrogen and hydrogen into a pressurized, heated iron tube over a catalyst of osmium (Briney). Carl Bosch then extended on this method, thus creating the "Haber-Bosch process" we know today. He endeavored to enhance Haber's idea to global proportions, erecting in 1912 a mammoth plant in Oppau, Germany. In five hours, Bosch's plant could synthesize one ton of liquid ammonia. It could generate twenty tons of nitrogen by 1914 (Briney).</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>When closely examining the process, one finds that it is nothing short of a miracle. The formula for the Haber-Bosch process is simple but crucial. We can summarize it with this straightforward equation: N2 + 3H2 ⇌ 2NH3. The process is remarkable because it accomplishes the difficult task of converting a stable molecule into a less stable one. The stable molecule, in this circumstance, is N2, the molecule which is more unstable in NH3. Erstwhile attempts to convert from the former to the latter blundered, mainly due to thermodynamic obstacles. The workaround, in this case, was Haber's iron catalyst mixed with a small quantity of aluminum. The high temperature and pressure at which the Haber-Bosch process conducts shifts the equilibrium to the right with great speed, favoring the 2NH3. While such a reaction would naturally shift left, the dismissal of ammonia allows for the opposite to occur (May).</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>

<p>How has one seemingly paltry formula touched the world? If not for the Haber-Bosch process, the human population would likely be much less than the staggering 8 billion permeating the Earth today. An appraised half of the global population is alive thanks to nitrogen fertilizer, whose absence would have cost the lives of an estimated every other individual.</p>

<p>A negative effect of the Haber-Bosch process is its role in eutrophication, which adversely affects our bodies of water. Runoff flowing through fertilized soil can pick up the fertilizer in its path with ease, as it readily dissolves it. Such a situation causes prodigious algal growth within water bodies, blocking sunlight and thus preventing photosynthesis among submarine plant life ("Haber Bosch Process").</p>

<p>Also, the Haber-Bosch process played a critical role in prolonging the first World War. It equipped Germany with munitions and fertilizer despite the British naval blockade ("Fritz Haber").</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The Haber-Bosch process, born from a need to enhance crop cultivation, is an innovative reaction that is far from fruitless.</p></li>
<li><p>When Fritz Haber rose to combat the dilemma of poor crops, his creative application of iron and aluminum virtually defied the laws of thermodynamics to increase the world's population by the billions, saturate bodies of water with copious amounts of algae, and protract the war to end all wars.</p></li>
<li><p>It's true, if not for this simple equilibrium reaction, the story of our world would have unfolded discordant from what we know today, proving the statement that equilibrium systems are a driving force behind our way of life in the past, present, and future.</p></li>
